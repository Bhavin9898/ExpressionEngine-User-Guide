# Contributing to the ExpressionEngine Documentation

Good documentation is the foundation of good software and your contributions can help make good documentation great.

If you're an ExpressionEngine user, then you have something to add. There is always room for more examples, clarifications, corrections and updates. Jump in and make a pull request or give us a heads up by reporting an issues.

## Contributing to the Documentation

Suggesting a change is easy and there is no way you'll mess up the public repo.

Start by [forking the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), the new branch you create is the one you'll do your work in.

Once you have your new branch, confirm you're actually in it! If you haven't already, make sure you've read though the [style guide](#style-guide). Then make your changes [inside of your feature branch](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

Push your changes to your fork of the repository, and when you're done, [send us a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

We'll take a look at your pull request, make sure everything looks alright, ask for any needed changes, and then merge it into the main code.

## Style Guide

Please read the [style guide](https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/style-guide.html) for samples and convention standards used in the ExpressionEngine user guide.

## Reporting Issues

Want to help but not a little daunted by the idea of making a pull request? We still want to hear from you. You can report errors in the documentation as [issues in the github repo](https://github.com/ExpressionEngine/ExpressionEngine-User-Guide/issues).  Just remember, the more detailed the report, the more likely someone will be able to make improvements.
