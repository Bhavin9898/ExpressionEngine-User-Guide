## Contributing to the Documentation

Suggesting a change is easy and there is no way you'll mess up the public repo.

Start by [forking the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), the new branch you create is the one you'll do your work in.

Once you have your new branch, make sure you're actually in it!  Then make your changes [inside of your feature branch](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

Push your changes to your fork of the repository, and when you're done, [send us a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

We'll take a look at your pull request, make sure everything looks alright, ask for any needed changes, and then merge it into the main code.

## Style Guideline

Please refer to [style_guide.rst](style_guide.rst) for samples and ReST convention standards used in the ExpressionEngine user guide. Please note that standard ReST renders will not be able to parse all of the directives, as many are specific to Sphinx.

### New Pages

If your contribution adds new pages to the user guide, please use the following attribution at the top of the file:

## Reporting Issues

Want to help but not a little daunted by the idea of making a pull request?  We still want to hear from you.  You can report errors in the documentation as [issues in the github repo](https://github.com/ExpressionEngine/ExpressionEngine-User-Guide/issues).  Just remember, the more detailed the report, the more likely someone will be able to make improvements.
