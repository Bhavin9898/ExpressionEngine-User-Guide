ExpressionEngine Add-On Development Guidelines
==============================================

Writing Documentation
---------------------

To help facilitate a consistent, easy-to-read documentation style for
ExpressionEngine add-ons, Ellislab is making the markup and CSS from the
ExpressionEngine user guide freely available to the community for their
use. For your convenience, a template file has been created that
includes the primary blocks of markup used with brief samples.

Don't forget to change the relative link to the stylesheet, your URL in
the Google search bar, and the other links, such as to your add-on's
home page and the breadcrumb links!
