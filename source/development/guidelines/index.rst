Guidelines
==========

Overview
--------

To facilitate reviewing, approving, and adding third-party
ExpressionEngine add-ons to the ExpressionEngine.com `Add-On
Library <http://expressionengine.com/downloads/addons/>`_, EllisLab has
defined the following programming guidelines. Even if you do not plan on
publicly releasing your add-on, you will greatly benefit from the
security, performance tips, and uniformity of code that results from
following these guidelines.

Some things may be different from your current coding style, but it is
important to remember that you rarely will be the only person working
with the code. Consistency makes it easier for other developers to
follow. And memories fade, so that "other developer" may simply be you,
six months later!

Guidelines
----------

The following areas discuss the various requirements for having your
add-on approved by EllisLab for inclusion in the Add-On Library. A
checklist is also provided to assist you in quickly reviewing your code
to see that the guidelines are met before submitting your add-on.

.. note:: Unless otherwise indicated, each item discussed is a
	*requirement*, and not an option for consideration.

-  :doc:`General Style and Syntax <general>`
-  :doc:`View Files and PHP Alternate Syntax <view_php_syntax>`
-  :doc:`Performance <performance>`
-  :doc:`Security <security>`

After reading and understanding the above sections, you can use the
:doc:`Summarized Checklist <checklist>` to assist you in reviewing your
code prior to submission.

Documentation
-------------

:doc:`Templates <documentation>` are available to assist you in
documenting your add-on.
