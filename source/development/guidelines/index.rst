Guidelines
==========

.. todo:: Audit for 3.0

Overview
--------

To facilitate quality third-party add-ons, EllisLab has defined the
following programming guidelines. Even if you do not plan on publicly
releasing your add-on, you will greatly benefit from the security,
performance tips, and uniformity of code that results from following
these guidelines.

Some things may be different from your current coding style, but it is
important to remember that you rarely will be the only person working
with the code. Consistency makes it easier for other developers to
follow. And memories fade, so that "other developer" may simply be you,
six months later!

Guidelines
----------

- :doc:`General Style and Syntax <general>`
- :doc:`View Files and PHP Alternate Syntax <view_php_syntax>`
- :doc:`Performance <performance>`
- :doc:`Security <security>`

After reading and understanding the above sections, you can use the
:doc:`Summarized Checklist <checklist>` to assist you in reviewing your
code prior to submission.

In-app Documentation
--------------------

You are strongly encouraged to make use of :doc:`in-app-documentation` for
a consistent user experience.
