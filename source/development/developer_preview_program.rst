Purpose
-------

The ExpressionEngine Developer Preview Program provides early access to
feature releases for the purpose of allowing developers of public
add-ons to ensure that their add-ons are compatible with new versions of
ExpressionEngine. The primary goals of the program are to:

- Ensure that public third-party add-ons are ready to go on the same day
  that EllisLab releases a new version of ExpressionEngine
- Work with third-party developers to continually improve the
  ExpressionEngine API and third-party software compatibility

Benefits
--------

Members of the ExpressionEngine Developer Preview Program receive the
following benefits:

- Early access to pre-release versions of ExpressionEngine (typically
  3-4 weeks ahead of a public release)
- Includes the pre-release builds for ExpressionEngine and the User Guide
- Email notifications of new pre-release builds
- Build notes to help point out changes that are most likely to impact
  third-party add-ons
- Access to the ExpressionEngine Developer forums to interact with the
  entire EllisLab Team as well as other developers in the program. This
  includes alerting the EllisLab team to potential show-stopping issues
  affecting their add-ons, and working with EllisLab Engineers on
  solutions to those issues prior to a release.

How to Join
-----------

In order to join the program you must have a publicly-available add-on
and have at least one ExpressionEngine 2 license in your account. If you
are interested in joining the Developer Preview Program, please send an
email to `team@ellislab.com`_ and include your EllisLab.com username and
a link to your publicly-available add-ons in your request.

My Add-ons are Bespoke, Can I Join?
-----------------------------------

The Developer Preview Program is only available to developers with
public add-ons and an ExpressionEngine license in order to maximize the
effectiveness of the engineering resources devoted to the program at
this time.

Security Researchers and Reporters
----------------------------------

We're always happy to work with security researchers and reporters and
if you've reported at least one valid security issue, we want you to be
part of the developer preview. If you've submitted an issue in the past
and aren't part of the program, just email us at `team@ellislab.com`_.
