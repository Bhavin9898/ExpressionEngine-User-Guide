======================

.. rst-class:: cp-path

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Tools --> Data --> SQL Manager --> Manage Database Tables`

In this section you can browse the contents of any of your database
tables to quickly check data. In addition, you can select one or more
tables and perform one of several actions on the table:

|Manage SQL Tables|

-  **Optimize selected tables**: This will perform a database
   optimization, which you are encouraged to run occasionally to
   eliminate database fragmentation.
-  **Repair selected tables**: This performs a standard SQL "repair" on
   your selected tables. Tables can occasionally become corrupted, which
   is typically repairable using this option.
