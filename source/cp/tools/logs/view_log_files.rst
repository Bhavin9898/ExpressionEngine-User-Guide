View Control Panel Log
======================

Control Panel Location: Admin > Utilities > View Control Panel Log
This section of the Control Panel allows you to view access logs for
your Control Panel. The system tracks all logins and logouts so that you
can see when the Control Panel was accessed. You can also clear the
current set of logs.

The following table columns are listed:

-  **Member ID**: The ID number of the member performing the access.
-  **Username**: The username of the member performing the access.
-  **IP Address**: The IP address from which the access was initiated.
-  **Date**: The date upon which the access occurred.
-  **Action**: What type of access was performed, such as "Logged in" or
   "Logged out".

Clear Log Files
---------------

Following the Clear Log Files link off of the main screen will cause all
of the current access logs to be cleared. A record of the clearing
action will appear in the new log list.
