.. Each Field

Name
~~~~

The name of the tag. This is what appears as the label for the button, so it should typically be short and obvious as to the function. Often this is the same as the actual HTML tag. This is a **required** field.

Opening Tag
~~~~~~~~~~~

The opening tag of the HTML tag. For instance, if you’re adding an entry for the strong tag (`<strong></strong>`) then the Opening Tag would be `<strong>`.

Closing Tag
~~~~~~~~~~~

The closing tag of the HTML tag. For instance, if you’re adding an entry for the strong tag (`<strong></strong>`) then the Closing Tag would be `</strong>`.

Shortcut
~~~~~~~~

This defines the shortcut key you can use to invoke the HTML tag while you are editing. For example, if you set the shortcut to be “h”, then the shortcut key combination will be ALT+h.
