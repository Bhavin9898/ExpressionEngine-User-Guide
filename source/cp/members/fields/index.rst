.. Each Action

Search Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will search members by id, username, screen name, and email, respecting
the current filters. This will render the :doc:`index`.

Create new
~~~~~~~~~~

This will take you to the member field's :doc:`create form <form>`.

Order
~~~~~

The reorder icon in the left-most column of the table allows you to reorder
the fields by dragging and dropping the rows.

Manage
~~~~~~

The icons in the manage column perform actions on the member in its row.

Edit
^^^^

This will take you to the member group's :doc:`edit form <form>`.

Bulk Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The checkbox in the right-most column of the table selects a button for a bulk
action. When at least one checkbox is checked the bulk action dropdown menu and
submit button will be made available in the lower righthand corner of the table.

Remove
^^^^^^

The selected member fields will be removed. Removing a member field will cause a
confirmation modal to appear that will summarize the action.
