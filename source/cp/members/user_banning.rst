**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Members --> User Banning`

The User Banning section of the Control Panel allows you to ban users by
IP address, email, or name.

.. _member-banned-ip-label:

Banned IP Addresses
-------------------

Specify IP addresses to ban from site registration and login. Use
wildcards to ban blocks of IP addresses. For example, ``123.321.*``.
Each IP address should be placed on a separate line.

You also set what happens when a user with a banned IP address tries to
access the site:

-  Restrict the user to viewing the site only. They will not be able to
   submit comments or do anything else except passively view the
   content.
-  Show the user a specific message.
-  Redirect the user to another specified site.

.. _member-banned-email-label:

Banned Email Addresses
----------------------

Specify email addresses to ban from site registration and login. Use
wildcards for partial email addresses. For example,
``*@spammydomain.com``. Each address should be placed on a separate
line.

.. _member-banned-username-label:

Restricted Usernames
--------------------

Specify usernames that cannot be used for member accounts, which can
be handy for reserving certain usernames for your own use.

.. _member-banned-screename-label:

Restricted Screen Names
-----------------------

Specify screen names that cannot be used for member accounts, which can
be handy for reserving certain screen names for your own use.
