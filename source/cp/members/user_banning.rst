============

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Members --> User Banning`

The User Banning section of the Control Panel allows you to ban users by
IP address, email, or name.

Banned IP Addresses
-------------------

Here you can specify any IP addresses you wish to ban. You may specify
full IP addresses or use wildcards to specify blocks of IP addresses.
For example, 123.321.\*. Each IP address should be placed on a separate
line.

You also set what happens when a user with a banned IP address tries to
access the site:

-  Restrict the user to viewing the site only. They will not be able to
   submit comments or do anything else except passively view the
   content.
-  Show the user a specific message.
-  Redirect the user to another specified site.

Banned Email Addresses
----------------------

Here you can specify any email addresses you wish to ban. You may
specify full email addresses or use wildcards to specify partial email
addresses. For example, \*@baddomain.com. Each address should be placed
on a separate line.

Restricted Usernames
--------------------

You can list usernames, preventing their use. This can be handy if you
would like to reserve certain usernames for your own use.

Restricted Screen Names
-----------------------

Similar to usernames, you can list Screen Names, preventing their use.
This can be handy if you'd like to reserve certain Screen Names for your
own use.
