There are a number of areas within the My Account section:


Personal Settings
-----------------

This page allows you to change the information that is stored in the
main profile fields such as Birthday, URL, Location, etc. This page also
contains any Custom Profile Fields you may have created.

Here you can set the signature, which can optionally be displayed with
channel entries, comments, and forum posts. You may style the signature
content as you wish.

~~~~~~~~~~~

You may select an avatar to associate with your member account. You may
choose from among the default avatars or you may upload your own if that
ability is enabled under :menuselection:`Members --> Membership
Preferences`.

Edit Your Photo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ability to upload Member Photos is enabled at
:menuselection:`Admin --> Membership Preferences`, this is where you can
upload a photo to be displayed in your member profile area.

Email Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may specify the email address associated with the account as well as
preferences related to receiving email. If you are not logged in with a
SuperAdmin account, you will need to submit the password associated with
the account in order to update these settings. The password is not
required when the person editing is a SuperAdmin account.

Both the Username and Screen Name for the account can be changed. In

associated with the account in order to update these settings. The
password is not required when the person editing is a SuperAdmin
account.

Localization Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data displayed on an ExpressionEngine page is determined dynamically for
each user viewing the site. Registered users can specify in which time
zone they reside as well as their language and time formatting
preference. Note that this is information that applies *only* to this
user account. To specify default server settings, go to
:menuselection:`Admin --> Localization Settings`.


Customize Control Panel
-----------------------

Control Panel Theme

Each user may independently choose which "theme" they desire to use when
viewing the Control Panel. This page allows them to set that preference
from among the available themes.

Main Menu Manager

This page lets you add custom own tabs to the main navigation of the
Control Panel. The tabs you add are viewable only by this user. To add a
new tab, first visit the destination page, then click the Add Tab link
at the top right of the page. In this section you can manage or remove
any tabs you have created.

These links will be visible only to you.

will appear, allowing you to customize your own Toolset.


Channel Settings

Ping Servers

Every member may specify their own individual set of "Ping Servers".
These Ping Servers will appear as options for new channel entries. By

added to by the user, though.
