**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Developer --> Categories`

.. Overview

This section of the Control Panel is for the management of channel
categories. It is where categories and category groups are created,
deleted, and preferences are set.

Category groups are *collections* of categories that can be assigned to
channels. You can create a separate group for each channel or use the
same group on multiple channels.

The main Categories screen shows a list of all current category groups in the left navigation and a sortable table of the categories in the currently selected category group.
