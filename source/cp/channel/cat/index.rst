**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Developer --> Channel Manager --> Category Groups`

.. Overview

This section of the Control Panel is for the management of channel
categories. It is where categories and category groups are created,
deleted, and preferences are set.

Category groups are *collections* of categories that can be assigned to
channels. You can create a separate group for each channel or use the
same group on multiple channels.

The main Categories screen shows a table of all the existing
category groups. It lists the category group name and provides links to
edit the preferences.
