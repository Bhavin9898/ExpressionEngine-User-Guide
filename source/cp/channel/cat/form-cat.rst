Parent category
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This drop-down list allows you to create a hierarchical relationship
between categories. The list dynamically contains all existing
categories for this category group. Selecting a parent category means
that the new category will be a "child" of the parent in the hierarchy.
The "None" option is available and will make the new category a "top
level" category with no parent.

Any :doc:`custom category fields <fields/index>` that exist for this category group will be included in the form.
