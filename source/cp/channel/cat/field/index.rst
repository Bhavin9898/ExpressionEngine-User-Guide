.. Overview

This section of the Control Panel is for the management of category
custom fields. It is where category fields are created, deleted, and
preferences are set.

The main Category Field Management screen shows a table of all the
existing category fields for the currently chosen category group. It
lists the category field name and provides links to edit the
preferences.
