.. Each Field

Name
~~~~

The "full channel name" is the descriptive name for the channel. This is
the name of your channel that you will show to visitors and display on
your site.

The full channel name is a required field. Spaces, punctuation, and
other special characters are allowed. For example, the channel's
descriptive name might be Joe's Personal Channel.

Short name
~~~~~~~~~~

The "short name" for the channel is the name used internally within the
program. It is also used when specifying a channel in variables of
parameters in your :doc:`/cp/design/index`. It is not normally
shown to visitors or otherwise exposed outside of your channel "setup".

The channel's short name is a required field. It must be a single word
with no spaces. The underscore character is allowed. For example, the
channel's "short name" might be joe_channel.

Maximum number of entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This limits the number of entries that are allowed to be published in the channel. This can be useful for channels that need their content creation limited to a set number of entries. For example a limit of 1 will make this channel effectively a "single entry channel" and only allow a single entry to be created. A limit of 5 would allow between 0 and 5 entries to be created. Leaving this setting blank (the default) applies no limits to the number of entries a channel can contain.
