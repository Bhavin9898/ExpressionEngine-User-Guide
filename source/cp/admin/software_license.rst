License Holder Contact Email
----------------------------

The contact email address for the owner of the software license. Use this
field to help manage and organize any communication that may occur about
your license.

For instance, you might use the email address associated
with your EllisLab.com account. Or if you are web agency who maintains
licenses for your clients, you might use a "sub-address", e.g.:
`license+clientname@example.com` which would be delivered to
`license@example.com` but have an additional identifier to clarify which
installation is being referenced.

longer have your license number, you can find it by visiting the
