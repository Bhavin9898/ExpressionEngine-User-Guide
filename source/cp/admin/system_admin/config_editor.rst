Config File Editor
==================

.. rst-class:: cp-path

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Admin --> System Administration --> Config File Editor`

The Config File Editor allows you to edit items in
the config.php file that would normally only be available via
hand-editing.

Before you begin editing or adding values, it is strongly recommended
that you back up your config.php file. An incorrectly set value here could
cause ExpressionEngine to not function as desired.

The Config File Editor screen shows a list of all the variables currently
used in the file, presented alphabetically.

To add a new value, enter the name in the textfield on the bottom of the
list labelled ($config['\_\_\_\_']) and enter its value in the box
beside it.

To modify a value, simply enter the new value in the textbox and press
"Update".
