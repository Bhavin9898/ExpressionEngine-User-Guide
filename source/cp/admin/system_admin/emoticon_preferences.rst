Emoticon Preferences
====================

.. rst-class:: cp-path

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Admin --> System Administration --> Emoticon Preferences`

This section of the Control Panel allows you to define preferences for
your Emoticon module. Smileys are graphical representations of commonly
used "emoticons", such as :-). When smileys are turned on, the system
will display a small graphic of a smiley-face instead of the emoticon
text, like this: |Smile|

Display Smileys?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With this preference you can choose whether or not the special codes for
smileys are rendered as graphics on your site. If this preference is set
to "No" then the actual code such as :-) or :lol: will be displayed
instead of the |image1| or |LOL|

URL to the folder containing your smileys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setting specifies the URL of the folder where you have your smiley
graphics located. This setting will automatically be filled in during
installation, so you should only need to change it if you have altered
where your smiley graphics are stored.

.. |Smile| image:: ../../../images/smile.gif
.. |image1| image:: ../../../images/smile.gif
.. |LOL| image:: ../../../images/lol.gif
