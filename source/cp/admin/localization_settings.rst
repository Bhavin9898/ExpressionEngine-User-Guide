Localization Settings
=====================

.. rst-class:: cp-path

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Admin --> Localization Settings`

This section of the Control Panel allows you to define the **default**
localization settings for your website.

.. note:: Each member of your site can override these default settings
   by changing their own :doc:`/cp/my_account/index` settings.

   .. _sysadmin-site-timezone-label:

Site Timezone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setting lets you specify the timezone where your **server** is
located. ExpressionEngine uses native PHP functions to deal with dates
and times, which base their output on the timezone of the server. If you
do not set this preference so that it correctly reflects the location of
your server it may cause problems with your dates and times. If you are
not sure where you server is located please ask your hosting provider.

Default Time Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may specify whether you would like the default time formatting to
follow either the "United States" or "European" conventions.
