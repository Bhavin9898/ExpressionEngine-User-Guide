Full Channel Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "full channel name" is the descriptive name for the channel. This is
the name of your channel that you will show to visitors and display on
your site.

The full channel name is a required field. Spaces, punctuation, and
other special characters are allowed. For example, the channel's
descriptive name might be Joe's Personal Channel.

Short Name
~~~~~~~~~~

The "short name" for the channel is the name used internally within the
program. It is also used when specifying a channel in variables of
parameters in your :doc:`/cp/design/templates/index`. It is not normally
shown to visitors or otherwise exposed outside of your channel "setup".

The channel's short name is a required field. It must be a single word

channel's "short name" might be joe\_channel.
