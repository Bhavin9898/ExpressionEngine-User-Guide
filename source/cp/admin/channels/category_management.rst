|Category Overview|

This section of the Control Panel is for the management of channel
categories. It is where categories and category groups are created,
deleted, and preferences are set.

Category groups are *collections* of categories that can be assigned to
channels. You can create a separate group for each channel or use the
same group on multiple channels.

The main Categories screen shows a table of all the existing
category groups. It lists the category group name and provides links to
edit the preferences.
