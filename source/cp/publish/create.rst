Create
======

.. rst-class:: cp-path

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Create`

.. Overview

This is the area where you'll create content for your site by
publishing new Entries to your Channels. If you have more than one Channel,
moving your cursor over the Publish menu will show all of your Channels and
allow you to select one.

.. tip:: Site builders can customize the display of the Publish Page on a per
   Channel bases by creating a custom layout.  Just go to the :doc:`Channel
   manager <../channel/index>` and click 'layouts' to access the :doc:`Form
   layout  <../channel/layouts/index>`.

Publish Form Tab
----------------

Title Field
~~~~~~~~~~~

This field contains the title of your channel entry. Titles can be up to
100 characters in length.

.. tip:: For those times where 'Title' isn't really the appropriate title, you
   can set a custom descriptive name for this field on a per channel basis.
   Just :doc:`edit the channel settings <../channel/channel-form>` and specify a **Title field label**.

URL Title
~~~~~~~~~

Here you can define a "human readable" URL title for your entry. URL
titles may only contain alpha-numeric characters and no spaces. The
purpose of a URL Title is to enable your entries to be accessed using a
URL such as::

	https://example.com/channel/comments/joes_first_entry/

If you do not specify a "URL Title" one will automatically be created
for you based upon your entry Title. URL Titles must be unique within a
channel, so if an entry with the same title already exists then the URL
Title will have a number appended to the end to make it unique.

.. note:: If you let the system create your URL Title for you it will
   convert spaces into underscores by default. For example, if the title
   of your entry is "Joe's First Entry" it will be converted to
   "joes_first_entry". If you prefer dashes to be used instead of
   underscores you can change it with the **Word Separator for URL Titles**
   preference under :menuselection:`Admin --> Channel Administration --> Global Channel Preferences`.

Entry Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The names and types of entry fields displayed will be determined by what
:doc:`/cp/channel/fields/index` you have defined for
this channel. If an entry field is set to be "hidden" by default, it
will have to be expanded by clicking on the field name before content
can be entered.

Save Revision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows the content editor to force a revision save.

Submit
~~~~~~

The Submit button allows you to save the entry and publish it to your
site.

Date Tab
--------

Entry Date
~~~~~~~~~~

The entry date is the primary date associated with an entry. You may use
the interactive calendar to set the date/time. If you specify a date in
the future, ExpressionEngine will not display the entry on your site
until the date has arrived. This behavior can be overruled if you
instruct ExpressionEngine to include "future dates" in the Channel Tags
in your Templates.

Expiration Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may *optionally* specify an expiration date for the entry, causing
the system to no longer show the entry anywhere on your website after
that date. You may also use an interactive calendar to set the
date/time.

Comment Expiration Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may *optionally* specify a date on which comments for this entry
will no longer be accepted. Once the date passes, the entry will act as
though the Allow Comments checkbox (see below) is unchecked. You may
also use an interactive calendar to set the date/time.

Categories Tab
--------------

You may assign your entries to one ore more categories. To select more
than one category you will typically hold down the CTRL (or CMD) key
while choosing the individual category names.

Clicking the Edit Categories link will permit you to add, edit, or
delete categories that appear in the list.

Options Tab
-----------

Author
~~~~~~

You may select the author for this entry from the drop-down list. By
default only the person submitting the entry is shown in the author
list. If you would like to enable other authors so that the author name
can be changed please see this :doc:`troubleshooting page
</troubleshooting/channels_and_entries/new_members_not_authors>` for
information.

Channel
~~~~~~~

This option is only available when *editing* an entry.

This drop-down list will contain all channels that share the same Fields, Field
Groups, Category Groups, and Statuses with the current channel for the
entry. Using this option, you can move an entry from one channel to
another channel that is set up similarly.

Status
~~~~~~

There are two primary statuses that are always available: Open and
Closed. Typically, "open" entries are viewable at your site, and
"closed" entries are not. You can add additional statuses for editorial
workflow in your :doc:`/cp/channel/tab-statuses` page, and opt to
display or suppress entries assigned to these by modifying the "status"
parameter found in the various "Channel" Tags in your Templates.

Make Entry Sticky
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this option is checked, then the entry will be "stuck" at the top of
the list when displaying multiple entries. This can be useful for things
like announcement posts.

Allow Comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this option is checked, then comments will be allowed for this entry.
When this option is unchecked, your comment submission form will be
suppressed. Any existing comments will still appear.


.. _publish_forum_tab:

Forum Tab
---------

.. note:: This tab will only appear if you have the Discussion Forum
   Module installed.


The Forum tab allows you to optionally publish a forum topic to be
associated with the channel entry. You can then automatically link to
the created forum topic from within your {exp:channel:entries} tag using
the :ref:`channel_entries_forum_topic_id` variable.

Forum Topic Title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may specify the title to use for the new thread in the forum.

Forum Topic Text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the main text for the forum thread.

You may use {permalink} to link from the Forum Entry to the Channel
Entry. This variable is replaced by the URL set in the **Comment Page
URL** preference under :menuselection:`Admin --> Channel Management`. The
URL Title of the entry will be automatically added. For example, this::

  <a href="{permalink}">my entry</a>

Would be rendered like this::

  <a href="https://example.com/channel/comments/ice_cream/">my entry</a>

Forum
~~~~~

Here you choose in which forum the new thread should be added.

Forum Topic ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of the previous settings, you may instead specify the ID for an
existing forum topic. This is useful if the forum topic already exists,
or if you want it to have a Poll or other special features.

This is an "either/or" type situation. You may either have a forum
thread created for you by specifying the title, text, and forum **or**
you may associate the entry with an existing ID.


Revisions Tab
-------------

.. note:: This tab will only appear if you have Entry Versioning enabled
   in the particular channel's preferences
   at :menuselection:`Admin --> Channel Administration --> Channels`.

When Entry Versioning is enabled, every time you save changes to your
entries they will be saved so you can go back in time and retrieve older
versions of your entries. The Revisions Tab will show a list of all
revisions for the entry being edited.

When a previous revision is selected it will be loaded into the Publish
page form so you can view or further edit it. If you save your changes,
a new revision will be created rather than updating the previous
revision. In other words, every time you click the save button a new
revision is stored.

.. _publish_pages_tab:

Pages Tab
---------

.. note:: This tab will only appear if you have the :doc:`Pages Module
   </add-ons/pages/index>` installed.

Pages URI
~~~~~~~~~

Here you can choose the URI that will be used to display this "page"
entry. Provide only the URI segments and not a full URL. Since this will
be used in the URL, only URL safe characters are allowed, i.e. low ASCII
alpha-numeric characters, underscore / dash separators, and periods.

**CORRECT:**

-  /company/roster/board/ceo/
-  /my_stuff/list.html

**INCORRECT:**

-  https://example.com/company/roster/board/ceo/
-  /my_stuff/Ã¼ber_list.html

.. note:: Entries cannot share the same Page URI. Each "page" entry must
   be given a unique URI so the system knows which entry to display when
   the Page URI is requested.

Template
~~~~~~~~

Here you can choose which template to use to display this "page" entry
when the above URI is requested.
