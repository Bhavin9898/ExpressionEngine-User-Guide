.. Overview

This utility allows you to make simple SQL dump backups of your ExpressionEngine database. For file backups, or more robust and automated database backup options, please refer to :doc:`Back-up your ExpressionEngine database and files </operations/database_backup>`.

When you click "Backup Database", a SQL dump will be created and stored in your ``system/user/cache/`` folder, named based on the date and time of the backup, e.g.: ``my_database_2017-10-20_09h20mPDT.sql``
