.. Overview

This Translation Utility page of the Control Panel allows you to
translate the core language files into other languages.

When you use this utility it will create a copy of any file you have
translated and put it into the following folder:
system/expressionengine/translations/

In order to be able to create translation files, you need to set the
file permissions to 666 or 777 for the following folder:
system/expressionengine/translations/

The main Translation Utility screen shows a list of all the language
files currently installed.
