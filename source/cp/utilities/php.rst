**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Developer --> Utilities --> PHP Info`

The PHP Info page of the Control Panel allows you to see the
configuration details of your PHP installation, via the standard
`phpinfo() <http://www.php.net/phpinfo>`_ command.

The page will show a great deal of information about your server, server
configuration, PHP installation, etc., which can be very useful if you
are trying to troubleshoot a problem or determine whether your server supports
a certain feature.
