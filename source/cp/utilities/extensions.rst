Manage Add-on Extensions
========================

.. rst-class:: cp-path

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Developer --> Utilities --> Debug Extensions`

.. Overview

Since Extensions are calling code within the ExpressionEngine code there is
a chance that an extension will interfere with how your site is working.
If you are unsure of which extension might be causing a problem you can
either turn them off one by one until the problem disappears.
