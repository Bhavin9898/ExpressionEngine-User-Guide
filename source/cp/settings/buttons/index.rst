.. Overview

This section of the Control Panel allows you to manage your default
*HTML buttons*. HTML buttons appear in the PUBLISH page and allow you to
add basic HTML to your entries.

	buttons via their My Account page. These default buttons are **only**
	used with members that have not defined their own.
