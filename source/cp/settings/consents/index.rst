User Consent Requests
---------------------

Custom consent requests can be created for any site need.  These requests are displayed for users just as native consents are and users may manage their consent through the :doc:`consent module </add-ons/consent/index>` just like native consents.


Create New
~~~~~~~~~~

This will take you to the consent request :doc:`create form <form>`.

New version
~~~~~~~~~~~

This will take you to the :doc:`edit form <form>`. If you edit an existing consent request, it creates a new version and stores the old version. Creating a new version nullifies all prior user consents and no users will have consented to the new version, regardless of whether they consented to an earlier version of the consent request.

Versions
~~~~~~~~

- Opens a modal with all versions of the selected consent request and the date each version was created. Selecting a version will show the consent title, name and request description.


Application Consent Requests
----------------------------

ExpressionEngine creates native consent requests for several standard categories of cookies.  Third party add-ons may also programatically create consent requests upon installation or update.  These consent requests cannot be deleted and the consent names are not editable.  However, the titles and descriptions may be updated.

New version
~~~~~~~~~~~

This will take you to the :doc:`edit form <form>`. If you edit an existing consent request, it creates a new version and stores the old version. Creating a new version nullifies all prior user consents and no users will have consented to the new version, regardless of whether they consented to an earlier version of the consent request.
