Install/Update Multiple Site Manager
====================================

Step 1
------

The first step is simply to download the Multiple Site Manager software
once you purchase it. Unzip the software to your local computer.

Step 2
------

After unzipping the package you will find a system directory.

-  Upload system/expressionengine/libraries/Sites.php to your
   system/expressionengine/libraries directory.
-  Upload system/expressionengine/controllers/cp/sites.php to your
   system/expressionengine/controllers/cp directory.
-  Upload system/expressionengine/language/english/sites\_lang.php

Step 3
------

If you are updating, there are no further steps required.

If you are installing for the first time, in your ExpressionEngine
Control Panel, go to Admin > General Configuration. Set **Enable
Multiple Site Manager** to 'Yes' and submit the form to save your
preferences.

That's it, the Multiple Site Manager is now installed. Clicking the name
of your Site in the upper right corner of the Control Panel will bring
up your Sites menu. Sites is a straight-forward, but very powerful
add-on. Please thoroughly review the documentation before using the
Multiple Site Manager.
