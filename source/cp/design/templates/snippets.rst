Snippets
========

|Design Snippets|
In this section of the Design area, you can create and edit
`Snippets <../../../templates/globals/snippets.html>`_.

Snippets can contain *any content*, including ExpressionEngine tags and
even PHP. For this reason, Snippets can only be edited by those with
Template Administration privileges.

NOTE: global\_vars that are defined within the index.php file, currently
don't render within snippets.

You will also not be able to nest snippets.
