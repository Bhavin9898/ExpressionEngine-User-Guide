Global Variables
================

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Design --> Templates --> Global Variables`

In this section you can define custom data that you would like to be
available globally in any Template. This is in addition to the standard
:doc:`/templates/globals/index` that are already available.

You could create a Global Variable for any number of purposes. One idea
would be for a piece of copyright text that would be included on every
page. By making it a Global Variable you can change it in one place and
immediately see the effects everywhere.

Global Variables can contain text, HTML, javascript, etc. but cannot
contain PHP code or ExpressionEngine tags that you wish to have parsed.
