System Message Templates
========================

.. rst-class:: cp-path

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Developer --> Templates --> Messages`

.. Overview

This section of the Control Panel is for managing the system message templates,
such as the Site Offline template and the User Messages template.

In the :doc:`/cp/settings/general` section of the Control
Panel you can specify whether or not your site is "Live". If the site is
not live then people will be presented with a message when they try to
access your page. This can be useful if you are performing maintenance
or other such things. This Message Page allows you to define the page
that will be shown to people when your site is not "Live".

Users often receive messages after performing actions in ExpressionEngine:
logging in, submitting a form, etc. In addition, they may sometimes be shown
error messages. You can determine how the page looks that displays these
messages.
