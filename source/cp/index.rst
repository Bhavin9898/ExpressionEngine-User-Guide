Control Panel Home Page
=======================

The :dfn:`Control Panel Home Page` is where you'll be directed upon logging
into the Control Panel.

You may have this page inform you when new versions of ExpressionEngine
are released. To enable this option, visit :dfn:`Admin > General Configuration`
and set **New Version Auto Check** to "yes". The check will be performed
every time you first log into the Control Panel.
