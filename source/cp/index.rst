The Control Panel
=================

Also known as the "back end," the Control Panel is where most of your
interaction with ExpressionEngine will take place. Here you'll publish and edit
your content, control the look and feel of your site, manage your members, and
much more.

The navigation is split into site builders on the right, and content creators on the left.

.. Nav elements needed: home, overview, site dropdown, view, logout, member menu
.. Footer elements
