**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Files --> Sync`

.. Overview

The Synchronize Files page allows you to synchronize the file records in
the database with the files stored in a given upload directory. When
submitted, all allowed file types in the directory will be checked
against the file records in the database. If there is no record in the
database, one will be added. For images, any additional sizes will be
generated and watermarked according to the file upload preferences for
that directory.

.. Screenshot (optional)

.. Lastly, any records in the database that do not have a
.. corresponding file in the main directory will be deleted from the
.. database along with any existing resized images. Existing images may
.. also be set to regenerate resized images from this page.
