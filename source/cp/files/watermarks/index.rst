Watermarks

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Files --> Watermarks`

.. Overview

This section of the Control Panel allows you to manage watermark settings. A
watermark is a unique text string or graphic that is automatically added to
your images to mark them as "yours" and to hamper other people from being able
to "steal" your images. You can create as many watermark types as you need and
apply them to your automatically created thumbnails while
:doc:`creating or editing an upload directory </cp/files/uploads/form>`.
