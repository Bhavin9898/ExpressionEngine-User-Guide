.. Overview

The Image Editor page of the Control Panel allows you perform basic
image editing tasks directly from ExpressionEngine. It is not intended
to replace powerful image editing software such as Photoshop or Gimp,
but rather to provide a quick option for common tasks from within the
control panel.
