Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to take advantage of all the features available in the Plugin
Manager, your system will need to meet the following requirements:

-  The "Magpie RSS Parser" Plugin must be installed. Normally it is
   included with ExpressionEngine by default.
-  You must have the Pclzip.lib file in your
   system/expressionengine/libraries folder. Normally it is included
   with ExpressionEngine by default.
-  Your system/expressionengine/third\_party folder must be writable by
   ExpressionEngine. This means it should be set to 777 permissions (for
   UNIX-based servers) or otherwise made writable by your webserver (for
   Windows-based servers).

Currently Installed Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This table lists all of your installed plugins, their installed version,
and a short description. Clicking on a plugin name leads to a subpage
with additional information about the selected plugin.

This section will also allow you to remove installed plugins. To do so,
select the plugin or plugins with the checkboxes on the right and then
use the Remove button at the bottom. You will receive a confirmation
page to make sure you really want to remove the selected plugins. There
is **no undo** feature here, so once a plugin is removed it is gone. You
can, of course, reinstall it.

Installing Plugins
------------------

To install plugins follow the detailed instructions in `Using
Plugins <../../templates/plugins.html>`_.
