Modules Manager
===============

Modules extend ExpressionEngine's capability
Control Panel Location: Add-ons > Modules
The Modules page is where you can see your currently installed Modules.

|Modules|
Integrating the modules into your web pages is covered in detail in the
`Modules and Tags <../../index.html#modules_docs>`_ area of the User
Guide.

Some Modules include their own Control Panel, enabling you to perform
certain actions specific to that Module. For example, in the Mailing
List Module Control Panel you can view, edit, and delete subscribed
email addresses. You can access the control panel for each module that
has one by clicking the name of the module in the Modules page.

To trigger updates for modules with updated packages, click the "Run
Module Updates" button above the module listing, or if the module has
its own control panel, visiting that module's control panel will also
trigger an update for that module.
