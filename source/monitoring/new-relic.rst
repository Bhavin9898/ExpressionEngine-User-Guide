Performance Monitoring with New Relic
=====================================

ExpressionEngine supports deep application monitoring with `New Relic
<http://newrelic.com/>`_
out of the box. When New Relic is deployed on your server,
you will instantly have visibility into performance metrics such as [1]_:

* Individual page transaction performance
* Slow SQL queries
* Detailed Stack traces that can help diagnose specific pain points
  in both first and third-party code.
* Identifying transactions that are memory / resource hogs

This information can be used to help you make decisions on where to
focus your efforts when optimizing, whether it be making changes to
templates, implementation caching mechanisms, modifying your add-ons,
or even just knowing which developer to seek out for support.
