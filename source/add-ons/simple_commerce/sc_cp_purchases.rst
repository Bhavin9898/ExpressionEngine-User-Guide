Simple Commerce â€“ Managing Store Purchases
==========================================

Managing store purchases in the Simple Commerce Module's control panel
is simple and efficient. You can view, edit, manually add, or export
your store's purchases.

Simple Commerce Home Page Options
---------------------------------

Add Purchase
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Add Purchase** link allows you to manually add purchases to your
store. This can be useful if you want to keep track of purchases made
before you began using the Simple Commerce system, or that come from a
source other than PayPal.

Edit Purchases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Edit Purchases** link allows you to view and edit information for
existing store purchases.

Export Purchases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Export Purchases** link will export and download a tab-delimited
file of all of your store purchases, for easy import into other
applications. The details of the PayPal transaction are output to the
file as a serialized array.
