Simple Commerce â€“ Managing Store Items
======================================

.. rst-class:: cp-path

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Developer --> Add-Ons --> Simple Commerce`

The Items screen gives you at a glance an overview of your store
items, their price, sale status, and number of purchases. You may select
items to edit or delete by checking the boxes on the right and selecting
the appropriate action from the drop-down menu next to the Submit
button. Items may be added by clicking the **Create New** button on the
top right.

Items Home Page Options

The **Create New** button allows you to select channel entries to add as
items to your store.

Edit Items

Adding Items
------------

To add a new item, click **Create New** from the Items screen. You will

with the following form. If you selected multiple items, you will be
able to see and edit the details for each item all from the same page.

unchecked, the :ref:`simple_commerce_purchase_tag` will
not show details, purchase links, or buttons for this item.

Regular Price
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the price the item will normally be sold for. Required.

Sale Price
~~~~~~~~~~

When on sale, the item will be sold for this price. Required, even if
the price is the same as the regular price.

When checked, the item will be sold at the Sale Price instead of the

Admin Email Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Send administrator email notifications for this item to the specified
email address.

Admin Email Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`email template <sc_cp_email_templates>` that will be used to
generate administrator notification emails for this item.

Customer Email Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

generate customer notification emails for this item.

New Member Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If selected, a member who purchases this item will automatically be
moved to the designated member group for this item.

For example, you could have a member group called "member\_paid" and
when a current registered member purchases an item called "Yearly
Membership" the member group would be automatically switched to the
"member\_paid" member group.

Admin Cancel Email Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For subscription items only, this is the :doc:`email
template <sc_cp_email_templates>` that will be used to generate
administrator notification when a subscription runs out.

Customer Cancel Email Template

template <sc_cp_email_templates>` that will be used to generate
customer notification e-mails when their subscription runs out for this
item.

Unsubscribe Member Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For subscription items, you can designate a member group to move the
member to if their subscription runs out.

For example, if you move members to the 'member\_paid' group when the
purchase a 'Yearly Membership', you could have a member group
'member\_unpaid' selected here. Once their subscription runs out, they
will automatically be switched to the unpaid member group.

Recurring Subscription?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If checked, the item is designated as a :ref:`recurring
payment <simple_commerce_recurring_payments>`.

Frequency of Subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The number of time periods between each recurrence of a subscription. If
you set a recurring payment time period, this value is required.

For example, if the subscription payment unit is 'Weeks' and the
subscription frequency is '2', purchasers will be billed by PayPal every
2 weeks.

For subscription items, you must set the time period used to calculate
the duration of the subscription. In conjunction with the subscription
frequency setting, this determines the automatic billing cycle for
subscription items.
