Forum Themes
============

.. rst-class:: cp-path

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Developer Tools --> Template Manager --> Forums`

The ExpressionEngine Forums make use of "themes" to determine how they
are displayed. The Forum Module comes with a "default" theme, which is
located in your installation under themes/user/forum/.

In order to edit the Templates inside the Control Panel, set the theme
folders and files to be writable. See :doc:`/troubleshooting/general/file_permissions` for details.

If you plan to make changes to your theme, we recommend that you make a
copy of the themes/user/forum/default/ directory, name it something
else, and make your changes to that one. You can easily switch
themes simply by choosing a new one under Default Preferences.
