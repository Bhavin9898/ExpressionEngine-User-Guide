Forum Themes
============

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Developer Tools --> Template Manager --> Forums`

The ExpressionEngine Forums make use of "themes" to determine how they
are displayed. The Forum Module comes with a "default" theme, which is
located in your installation under themes/user/forum/.

In order to edit the Templates inside the Control Panel, set the theme
folders and files to 666 permissions (for Windows servers, you need to
make them "writable").

If you plan to make changes to your theme, we recommend that you make a
copy of the themes/user/forum/default/ directory, name it something
else, and make your changes to that one. You can easily switch
themes simply by choosing a new one under Default Preferences.
