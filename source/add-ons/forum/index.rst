Introduction
************

The ExpressionEngine Discussion Forum Module allows you to create and
manage a full-featured forum on your site. This includes everything from
posting and replying to editing threads and private messaging other
users. The Module also allows you to easily administer your forum both
for setup and to create and assign Moderators and Administrators. You
can even easily change the look and feel of your forum by simply
applying another "theme" to it.

.. important:: The Discussion Forum is an ExpressionEngine Module, and
   therefore requires that you be running ExpressionEngine. This module
   requires a `purchased <https://store.ellislab.com/>`_
   ExpressionEngine license.
