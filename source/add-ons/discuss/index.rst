Introduction
************

The ExpressionEngine Discuss Module allows you to create and manage beautiful and modern community forums, with the flexibility and power that you expect from ExpressionEngine. Designing your forums has never been easier, as you are not limited to set "themes", nor do you have to learn some new templating scheme, or fuss with integrating separate applications. Build your community with confidence, and 100% integration with the rest of your content and design.
