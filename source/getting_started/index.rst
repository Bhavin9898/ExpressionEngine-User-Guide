Introducing ExpressionEngine 2
==============================

Creating a site with ExpressionEngine requires that you be
comfortable with basic HTML. If you don't know the HTML basics consider
spending some time reading a tutorial. We recommend `j-learning.org's
basic HTML tutorial <http://www.j-learning.org/build_it/page/basic_html/>`_.

Introducing ExpressionEngine 2
------------------------------

This tutorial assumes that you are beginning with
the *empty installation*. We'll walk through the process of
setting up a basic infrastructure:

#. `Log in to the Control Panel <logging_in.html>`_
#. `Create a Channel Field Group and Channel
   Field <create_custom_fields.html>`_
#. `Create a Category Group and Category <create_categories.html>`_
#. `Create a Status Group <create_status_group.html>`_
#. `Create a File Upload Preference <create_file_upload_pref.html>`_
#. `Create a Channel and Assign Groups <create_channel.html>`_
#. `Publish an Entry <publish_new_entry.html>`_
#. `Output and View your Content <output_content.html>`_

Before Starting
---------------

In order to use this tutorial you must have SuperAdmin access to a
working ExpressionEngine site. The account created during the
installation process has SuperAdmin access, so if you installed
ExpressionEngine yourself you're all set. If someone else installed
ExpressionEngine for you, double check with them that you have
SuperAdmin access.

Next: `Log in to the Control Panel <logging_in.html>`_
