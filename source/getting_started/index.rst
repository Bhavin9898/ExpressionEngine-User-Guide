Introducing ExpressionEngine 2
==============================

**Note:** To create a site using ExpressionEngine requires that you be
comfortable with basic HTML. If you don't know the HTML basics consider
spending some time reading a tutorial. We recommend `j-learning.org's
basic html
tutorial <http://www.j-learning.org/build_it/page/basic_html/>`_. Not
only is it a wonderful learning resource geared toward developing
community-based web sites, but it's built using ExpressionEngine, so
it's an excellent example site.

Introducing ExpressionEngine 2
------------------------------

The goal of this tutorial will be to give a brief introduction to
ExpressionEngine 2. This tutorial assumes that you are beginning with
the *empty installation*. The tutorial will walk through the process of
setting up a basic infrastructure within ExpressionEngine, including:

#. `Log in to the Control Panel <logging_in.html>`_
#. `Create a Channel Field Group and Channel
   Field <create_custom_fields.html>`_
#. `Create a Category Group and Category <create_categories.html>`_
#. `Create a Status Group <create_status_group.html>`_
#. `Create a File Upload Preference <create_file_upload_pref.html>`_
#. `Create a Channel and Assign Groups <create_channel.html>`_
#. `Publish an Entry <publish_new_entry.html>`_
#. `Output and View your Content <output_content.html>`_

Before Starting
---------------

In order to use this tutorial you must have Super Admin access to a
working ExpressionEngine site. The account created during the
installation process has Super Admin access, so if you installed
ExpressionEngine yourself you're all set. If someone else installed
ExpressionEngine for you, double check with them that you have Super
Admin access.

You don't need to be an HTML expert to do this tutorial but at a minimum
you should understand the concept of HTML tags. If you'd like to take a
brief HTML refresher course we recommend `j-learning.org's Basic HTML
review <http://www.j-learning.org/build_it/page/basic_html/>`_.

And finally, from this point on we're going to refer to ExpressionEngine
as EE. Let's begin.

Next: `Login to the Control Panel <logging_in.html>`_
