the uploaded file.

Create a File Upload Preference

Go to Content > Files > File Upload Preferences

Using FTP create a directory to store your files in on the server. Fill
in the Descriptive Name, Server Path to Upload Directory, and URL of
Upload Directory pointing to the directory just created.
