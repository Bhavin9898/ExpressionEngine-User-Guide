Introducing ExpressionEngine 2: Status Groups
=============================================

Statuses can be used to control the visibility of entries, as well
as an overall editorial workflow. They are organized into groups.

Create a Status Group
---------------------

Go to: :menuselection:`Admin --> Channel Administration --> Statuses`

.. figure:: ../images/ee2_cp_custom_entry_statuses.png
   :align: center
   :alt: EE2 CP Custom Entry Statuses

Click *Create New Status Group* and create a group called "Example".
This will contain a set of custom statuses.

.. figure:: ../images/ee2_cp_create_new_status_group.png
   :align: center
   :alt: EE2 CP Create New Status Group

All Status Groups automatically include the Open and Closed statuses.

.. figure:: ../images/ee2_cp_status_group.png
   :align: center
   :alt: EE2 C{} Status Group

Entries with a status of Closed will not be shown unless explicitly
stated in the templates. Entries with a status of Open will always show
unless explicitly stated in the templates.
