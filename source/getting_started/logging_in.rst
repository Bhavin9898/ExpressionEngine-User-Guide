Introducing ExpressionEngine 2 - Log in to the Control Panel
============================================================

The Goal: Learn where the EE Control Panel is typically located, log in
to the Control Panel, and start using EE.

Login to the Control Panel
--------------------------

After installing EE you were given two links. The first is a link to
your EE web site, the second is a link to your Control Panel. Hopefully
you saved those links somewhere. If you did, go to the Control Panel now
and log in with the Username and Password created during the
installation process.

If you don't have your Control Panel link, the default URL is::

	example.com/system/

System is the default name of the main EE directory. If you renamed your
system folder during installation, just replace "system" with whatever
you renamed the system folder to. For example, if you renamed your
system folder to acme, then the URL to the Control Panel would like::

	example.com/acme/

Likewise, if you installed EE in a subfolder on your site, you would
adjust the URL accordingly. For example, if you installed EE in the
ezine directory of your server, then URL would look like::

	example.com/ezine/system

You'll know you're at the right place when you see this:

.. figure:: ../images/ee2_cp_login.png
   :align: center
   :alt: EE Control Panel Login

Now log in using your username and password. After logging in, you'll be
at the Control Panel Home screen.

.. figure:: ../images/ee2_cp_home.png
   :align: center
   :alt: EE2 Control Panel Home
