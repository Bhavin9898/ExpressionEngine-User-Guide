Introducing ExpressionEngine 2: Channels
========================================

Channels are where you will store the majority of your data. They can be
used for any data type, including files, news articles, a catalog of
books, or whatever you can imagine for it to hold.

Create a Channel
----------------

Go to: :menuselection:`Admin --> Channel Administration --> Channels`

.. figure:: ../images/ee2_cp_channel_management.png
   :align: center
   :alt: EE2 CP Channel Management

Click *Create a New Channel* and create a Channel with the Full Channel
Name of "Example". Set the Channel Name to "example".

.. figure:: ../images/ee2_cp_channel_names.png
   :align: center
   :alt: EE2 CP Channel Names

Choose "Yes" for Edit Group Preferences. This is where you will assign
the groups we made earlier to this Channel.

**Important:** If no Status Group is assigned then all entries made by a
non-Superadmin will default to Closed.

Enter a New Template Group Name to display data for this Channel. Call
this example

   :align: center
