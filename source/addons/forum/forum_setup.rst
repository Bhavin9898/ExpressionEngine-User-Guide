Discussion Forum Setup
======================

When setting up a new forum, it is typically best to do things in a
certain order.

Create a Forum Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can begin setting up your forums, you will need to have at least 
one :doc:`forum board <forum_boards>` for your forums to belong to. 


Set "Default Preferences"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the Forum Management tab in the Forum Module there is a General
Preferences link. This area will allow you to set the default
preferences that will be used whenever a *new* forum is created. This
area **will not** globally change all preferences for existing forums;
it is used to define the base settings that will be in place when a new
forum is created. Each forum can have its preferences set independently
after creation.

Use the Default Preferences area to set the default values to be applied
to *new* forums. To alter settings for existing forums, use the Edit
link for that forum.

Set "Default Permissions"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the Forum Management tab in the Forum Module there is a Default
Permissions link. As with the "Default Preferences", this area allows
you to set the default permissions that will be used when a *new* forum
is created. Each forum has its own permissions settings, so changing
these settings **will not** affect existing forums.

Use the Default Permissions area to set the default permission values to
be applied to *new* forums. To alter permissions for existing forums,
use the Permissions link for that forum.

There are seven types of permissions you can set. It should be obvious
what each type of permission allows.

-  Can View Forum
-  Can View Hidden Forums
-  Can View Posts
-  Can Post
-  Can Report
-  Can Upload
-  Can Search

For each type of permission, you can determine whether or not it is
available for any of your Member Groups. Check a checkbox in a
permission column for a Member Group row if you want that Member Group
to have that permission. For instance, you might not want to allow a
particular Member Group to be able to post in your forum. If that's the
case, then make sure the "Can Post" checkbox is unchecked for that
Member Group.

The Discussion Forum module requires membership in order to post in the
forums. Non logged-in users (the "Guest" Member Group) cannot post to
the forums.

The "blank" boxes in the last column and last row allow you to easily
select or de-select an entire column or row.

Member Groups are managed under :menuselection:`Admin --> Members and
Groups --> Member Groups` since Member Groups are used throughout your
site and not just as part of the forum.

Add a New Category
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you've set the default preferences and permissions you can start to
add the actual forums. First, you'll need to create at least one
"Category" for your forum. Let's imagine that your site is about sports
and politics. So, you first go to the Add a New Category link under the
Forum Management tab in the Forum Module. Here you could create a
"Sports" category. Later, you can create separate forums for different
types of sports. You might also create a "Politics" category.

A "category" in the Forum Module is simply a way to organize one or more
forums together.

Add your Forums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you've created one or more categories, you can create forums
inside them. Use the Add a new forum to this category link under the
category in which you're interested. For instance, under the Sports
category, you could click that link and then create a "Football" forum.
You might also create "Basketball", "Baseball", "Rugby", and "Hockey"
forums in that category.

In the Politics category you might create "Democrat", "Independent", and
"Republican" forums.

When creating your forums, you can set the "Status" for the forum. There
are three statuses:

-  **Live**: This is the normal state for a forum. It allows new
   postings.
-  **Read Only**: A Read Only forum does not permit new posts. You could
   use this status if you have a forum that you still want to keep the
   contents available for viewing but don't want anything new added. You
   can think of this as a sort of "archival" mode.
-  **Hidden**: A Hidden forum is one that is only viewable by people
   given permission to do so (via the forum permissions, as mentioned
   earlier).

Remember how you set your Default Preferences and Default Permissions
earlier? When you create these new forums, each one is created with
those settings and permissions applied to them. So, what if you want
some of your forums to have slightly different preferences or
permissions?

Customizing Particular Forums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a forum has been created, you can use the Edit link for that forum
to adjust its settings. At the bottom of the table you'll see a Show
Preferences link; clicking on that will expand additional preferences
that you can adjust. In this way, you can create a forum and have the
Default Preferences applied initially and then later adjust that
particular forum differently.

In the same way, you can use the Permissions link for a particular forum
to adjust the permissions that apply to only *that* forum.

Changing the Display Order of Forums and Categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often, you won't create your categories and forums in the ultimate order
in which you'd like them displayed. In the main Forum Management screen
you can use the Up and Down arrow links to change the order of things.
Using the arrows for forums will change the order of those forums within
the category. You can use the arrows for the categories to change the
order in which the categories are displayed.
