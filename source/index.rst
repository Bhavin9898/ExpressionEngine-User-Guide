ExpressionEngine User Guide
###########################

Welcome to the ExpressionEngine User Guide. The guide you are reading right now is incomplete while we reorganize and rewrite some of it. Currently the table of contents on the left will only take you to areas that are relevant to your goals for the Developer Preview, namely the Add-on Developer section of the User Guide. The objective is to answer the following questions for you:

- What are the over-arching things I need to know?
- What's new, what's deprecated, and what's gone?
- What steps do I need to take to convert my existing add-ons?

If you have questions or feedback, don't hesitate to drop a thread into the :ellislab:`Developer Preview Forums <forums/viewforum/128/>` or the private `Developer Preview Slack group <https://eedevpreview.slack.com/>`_.
