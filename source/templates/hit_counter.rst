Hit Counters
============

Every time a template is accessed a counter is incremented. To display
the number of hits, put the following variable in any template::

	{hits}

The hit count for each template can be manually altered in the
template's preferences under :menuselection:`Design --> Templates -->
Template Manager`.

Entry "View" Tracking
---------------------

In addition to tracking page hits, EE lets you track the number of views
a particular channel entry has received. For more information regarding
this feature please read about the :ref:`channel-entries-track-views` parameter.
