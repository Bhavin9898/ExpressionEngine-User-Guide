Differences between Modules, Plugins, Extensions, and Expansions
================================================================

ExpressionEngine includes different types of add-ons:

-  Plugins are small run-time enhancements. They are simple to create.
   The plugin architecture is designed to enable the plugin's author to
   affect the output of ExpressionEngine in a wide variety of ways.
-  Modules are larger systems that can be integrated into the
   ExpressionEngine control panel. Almost anything that can be achieved
   as a stand-alone application can be designed as an ExpressionEngine
   module. Modules typically store content in the database and can have
   actions associated with them.
-  Extensions are "hooks" in the system that allow the add-on to pass
   information and add functionality to existing interfaces.
-  Expansions add a new layer of functionality to ExpressionEngine.
   There is only one expansion: the Multiple Site Manager.
