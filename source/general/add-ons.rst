Add-Ons

ExpressionEngine is the ultimate in flexibility, designed to be a platform
for developers to easily extend to enable rich functionality. Like an operating
system, it ships with a set of "apps" to cover the basic necessities right out
of the box. We call those apps *Add-Ons*.

Have a need for :doc:`RSS </add-ons/rss/index>`?  :doc:`Search
</add-ons/search/index>`?  :doc:`Comments </add-ons/comment/index>`?  Install
those packages, and you'll have a whole new set of tools at your disposal.

And just like an OS, Add-Ons that don't come :ref:`included with
ExpressionEngine <add_ons_included_in_expressionengine>` can be added to bring
even more functionality to the platform. ExpressionEngine was built on a
`CodeIgniter <http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/>`_ foundation and includes a
robust :doc:`developer API </development/index>` to enable rapid Add-on
development, and a rich ecosystem filled with high-quality Add-Ons has grown up
around it.

With Add-Ons :ref:`available from EllisLab <add_ons_available_for_download>` and
third-party developers, you can construct a web publishing system tailored to
fit the needs of the project at hand.
