ExpressionEngine is remarkably capable right out-of-the-box. Like an Operating
System, it ships with a set of apps to get you started. And like an OS,
ExpressionEngine was designed with more in mind. Rather than cast you into 
a mould, ExpressionEngine let's you shatter the mould!

A `CodeIgniter <http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/>`_ foundation and
robust :doc:`Developer API </development/index>` have allowed EllisLab and 
third-party developers to add functionality to ExpressionEngine. Any piece of 
software that adds to ExpressionEngine is called an 
:ref:`Add-On <add-ons-included-in-expressionengine>`. Add-On packages enable
ExpressionEngine to be amazingly flexible.

Have a need for :doc:`RSS </modules/rss/index>`? 
:doc:`Search </modules/search/index>`? 
:doc:`Comments </modules/comment/index>`? 
Install those packages and then you're ready to build those features.

By the way, you aren't limited to what ships with ExpressionEngine. EllisLab 
offers a :ref:`collection of Add-Ons <add-ons-available-for-download>` on 
GitHub and there are an ever-growing number of third-party Add-Ons available 
that extend ExpressionEngine in amazing ways.

With Add-Ons, you build just the features and functionality your clients need. 
Itâ€™s entirely possible to use EE on dozens of projects and deliver a tailored 
experience with each one.
