Getting the Most out of ExpressionEngine
########################################

********************************
Get Familiar with the User Guide
********************************

All of ExpressionEngine's functionality is well-documented. Explore
the User Guide and get familiar with the software.

The :doc:`/modules/index` section of the User Guide is what you'll likely
reference most. Since most of EE's functionality is built into Modules,
and EE Tags are used to access that functionality, being familiar with this
section of the User Guide is very helpful.
