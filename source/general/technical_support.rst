advice on getting the best technical support possible from the Community
Forums and introduce you to additional troubleshooting and technical
resources.

Before Contacting Technical Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend doing the following before contacting Technical Support.

#. Check your HTML and EE code for typos. For example, look to see if
   there is a missing " or perhaps a tag that was left unclosed or a
   misspelled variable.

#. Check the User Guide to make sure you are implementing the EE Tag,
   Global Variable, or other functionality correctly.

#. Check the `User Guide:
   Troubleshooting <http://expressionengine.com/user_guide/troubleshooting/>`_.
   The troubleshooting section of the user guide has answers to the most
   common errors and issues that people encounter.

#. Do an `Advanced Search <http://expressionengine.com/forums/search/>`_
   on the ExpressionEngine Community Forums. Chances are that someone
   has asked the same question you are asking.

#. Is the issue you are experiencing related to a third-party add-on?
   Please contact the add-on's author for assitance.

#. Is the issue you are experiencing a bug? Check the `Bug
   Tracker <http://expressionengine.com/bug_tracker/list_2.x/>`_.
