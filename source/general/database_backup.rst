Database Backup
===============

Since ExpressionEngine stores most of your content in a database it is
highly recommended that you preform regular database backups. Some
hosting providers backup account databases as part of their service, but
many do not. And even among those that do, not all of them perform
backups at very frequent intervals so you are encouraged to make regular
backups part of your site management strategy. Contact your host for
more information.

`PHPMyAdmin <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php>`_, available
on most hosts, includes an export utility for creating database backups.
