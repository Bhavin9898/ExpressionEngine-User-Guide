ExpressionEngine is built on CodeIgniter, Ellislab's Open Source PHP framework.
Having CodeIgniter as its foundation makes ExpressionEngine incredibly
extensible. Along with the Core framework, ExpressionEngine offers developers an
API. This has allowed the EllisLab Community to develop and offer an amazing
number of ExpressionEngine Add-Ons!

ExpressionEngine Add-Ons come in two flavors. Add-Ons made by EllisLab are
:term:`first-party`, Add-Ons made by outside developers are :term:`third-party`.

No matter where they come from, there are six distinct types of ExpressionEngine
Add-Ons. The type of Add-On is important to know, since when and how the Add-On
works with ExpressionEngine is key to undertanding what to expect.
