   MSM Site
   MSM Sites
      A separate domain, subdomain, or section of a website that is enabled by
      the Multiple Site Manager expansion. Though some data (such as the member
      database) is shared among all MSM Sites under the same ExpressionEngine
      installation, each MSM Site is administered in its own workspace in the
      Control Panel, separate from other MSM Sites.

      :doc:`Additional MSM Sites </cp/sites/additional_sites>` can be purchased in the store.
