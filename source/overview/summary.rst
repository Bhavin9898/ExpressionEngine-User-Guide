|ExpressionEngine Overview|

-  The Control Panel is your main interface to ExpressionEngine. It's
   where you publish and edit content, and manage your site.
-  A Channel consists of your entries, comments, preferences, and other
   related "data." It is simply *information*.
-  A Template represents a single page of your site. It is similar to an
   *HTML file*.
-  ExpressionEngine Tags permit you to show data from a Channel, or
   other Modules and Plugins, in your Templates.
-  A Template Group contains a collection of Templates. It is a
   container similar to a *folder*.
