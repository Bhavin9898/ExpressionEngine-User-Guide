Meet the Control Panel
======================

Also known as the "back end," the Control Panel is where most of your
interaction with ExpressionEngine will take place. Here you'll publish
and edit your content, manage your Templates and System Preferences,
send email to your Mailing List, manage your personal information, and
more.
