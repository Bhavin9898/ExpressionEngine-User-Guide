Making the Most of ExpressionEngine
===================================

Begin with the Basics
---------------------

The User Guide starts with the basics. This includes `Installation and
Update instructions <../index.html#install_docs>`_, the `Getting
Started <../index.html#getting_started>`_ section and the `Getting
Started Tutorial <../getting_started/index.html>`_. We recommend that
you review these sections before attempting any major development with
ExpressionEngine.

Get Familiar with the User Guide
--------------------------------

Almost all of ExpressionEngine's functionality is organized into
`Template Information <../index.html#template_docs>`_, `Modules and
Tags <../index.html#modules_docs>`_, and `Control
Panel <../index.html#cp_docs>`_ settings. The User Guide is organized in
the same way. Information that isn't directly about Templates, Modules,
or Control Panel settings is located in the `General
Information <../index.html#gen_docs>`_ section of the User Guide.

The `Modules and Tags <../index.html#modules_docs>`_ section of the User
Guide is what you'll likely reference most. Since most of EE's
functionality is built into Modules, and EE Tags are used to access that
functionality, being familiar with this section of the User Guide is
very helpful.

Subscribe to the EllisLab News Feed
-----------------------------------

We highly recommended that you subscribe to the `EllisLab Network News
feed <http://expressionengine.com/feeds/rss/full>`_. We announce all
major releases in the feed along with tips, resources, and other
information regarding ExpressionEngine, including any security related
news.

Review and Subscribe to the ExpressionEngine Releases Forum
-----------------------------------------------------------

The `ExpressionEngine Releases
forum <http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewforum/107/>`_ is dedicated
to announcing new versions. We recommend that web developers and those
responsible for maintaining an ExpressionEngine site subscribe to the
`forum RSS feed <http://expressionengine.com/forums/rss/107/>`_.

Get Involved with the ExpressionEngine Community Forums
-------------------------------------------------------

We can't stress enough the importance of the `ExpressionEngine Community
Forums <http://expressionengine.com/forums/>`_. We have one of the best
user communities on the internet. On the forums, you'll find people who
can help you with just about anything. In addition, we have dedicated
staff and volunteers who will help you get the most out of EE. You might
start out by hanging out in `The
Lounge <http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewforum/28/>`_.

Go ahead and explore the Forums and get involved. Remember, the more you
give to the community, the more you'll get back.
