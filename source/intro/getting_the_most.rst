Getting the Most Out of ExpressionEngine
########################################

********************************
Get Familiar with the User Guide
********************************

ExpressionEngine is very well-documented. Explore the User Guide to get familiar
with the software.

The :doc:`User Guide Home </index>` will guide you to all major parts of the documentation, including application setup, using ExpressionEngine, technical reference guides, and add-on development.

*****************************
Get Involved in the Community
*****************************

We can't stress enough the importance of the :ellislab:`EllisLab Community </community>`. We have one of the best user communities on the Internet (we think _the_ best), and you'll find people who can help you with just about anything in a variety of places.

Forums
======

You might want to get started by hanging out in :ellislab:`ExpressionEngine Forums </forums>`. Go ahead and explore the Forums and get involved. Teaching and helping others troubleshoot can be one of the best ways to boost your own ExpressionEngine skills.

Chat
====

Looking for real-time chat with fellow ExpressionEngine users? Look no further than the :ellislab:`free Slack Team </community#slack>`. Whatever part of the world you live in, a fellow ExpressionEngine enthusiast is also online. As with the forums, helping and conversing here can strengthen your web development skills and introduce you to techniques that you may not have thought of.

Social Media
============

On Twitter, you can reach us ``@ellislab`` and the broad community of users with the ``#eecms`` hashtag. A lot of ExpressionEngine-related news and tips are shared via ``#eecms``, so add it to your watch list. For example the `Tweetdeck <https://tweetdeck.twitter.com>`_ and `Tweetbot <http://tapbots.com>`_ apps can track that hashtag for you.

Go forth and conquer!
