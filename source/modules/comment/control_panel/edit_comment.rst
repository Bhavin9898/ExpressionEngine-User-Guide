Comment Edit
============

Control Panel Location: Modules > Comment Module > Comment Edit
The edit page shows the recorded comment data and allows editing of the
individual comment.

|Comment Control Panel|
Comments by registered members will use the member data when displaying
name, email, url and location. Thus these fields will not be editable
for registered members.

If accessed by an administrator with only 'Can Moderate Comments'
privileges, only the status will be editable.
