ExpressionEngine includes a Comment Module, used to show user-submitted
comments on your site. The Comment Control Panel allows you to manage
your submitted comments.

In addition, the comment module supports `Comment
Pagination <../channel/pagination_page.html>`_. You can also display
`Recent Comments <recent_comments.html>`_.
