Updated Sites Module
====================

This Updated Sites Module allows other sites to ping your site when they
have created new content. You can then display a "recently updated
sites" list based on the sites that send you pings.

The module will accept either a standard Channels.com style ping (which
is most common) or an Extended Ping.

There are two areas of information for this module:

-  `Receiving Pings <receiving_pings.html>`_
-  `Displaying Pings <displaying_pings.html>`_
