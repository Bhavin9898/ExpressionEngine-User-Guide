Default Status
--------------

Set a default status for this channel. Any user-submitted status will be ignored.

Allow guests to post entries?
-----------------------------

Choose whether to allow guests to post entries.

Logged Out Member ID
--------------------

If you choose to allow guests to post entries, you must enter the
member\_id of a member account you'd like to
appear as the entry's author. During the generation of the entry,
this member account's privileges will be used (SafeCracker does not
actually log guests in, and doesn't give them the ability to login to
the backend or any other shenanigans). This member account must have
sufficent access to add or edit content in this channel. You can
enter the member\_id directly, or you can choose from a list of
members.

Require captcha for guests?
---------------------------

If you choose to allow guests to post entries, you can specify whether or not to require a captcha.
