Email
=====

ExpressionEngine includes an Email Module in order to provide the
ability to create contact forms and tell-a-friend forms.

.. note:: The Email Module is available only with a `purchased <https://store.ellislab.com/>`_
   ExpressionEngine license.

-  The :doc:`Contact Form </modules/email/contact_form>` tag allows your
   visitors to send you email directly from your site.
-  The :doc:`Tell-a-Friend </modules/email/tellafriend>` tag allows your
   visitors to share your content via email with someone else.

.. note::
   The Email Module is not installed by default, so before using
   these tags make sure it is installed via the :doc:`Modules
   Page </cp/add-ons/module_manager>` at :menuselection:`Admin --> Modules`.
