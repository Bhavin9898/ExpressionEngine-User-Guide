Email Module
============

ExpressionEngine includes an Email Module in order to provide the
ability to create contact forms and tell-a-friend forms.

-  The `Contact Form <contact_form.html>`_ tag allows your visitors
   to send you email directly from your site.
-  The `Tell-a-Friend <tellafriend.html>`_ tag allows your visitors
   to share your content via email with someone else.

.. note::
   The Email Module is not installed by default, so before using
   these tags make sure it is installed via the `Modules
   Page <../../cp/add-ons/module_manager.html>`_ at :menuselection:`Admin --> Modules`.
