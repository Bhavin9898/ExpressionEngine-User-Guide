Updating the Wiki Module
========================

These instructions are only applicable for upgrading an existing
installation. If you have not installed the Wiki Module, you will need
to follow the `Wiki Installation
Instructions <wiki_installation.html>`_.

Step 1: Update ExpressionEngine
-------------------------------

Make sure you are running the latest version of ExpressionEngine. As one
of the default modules, all of the necessary files will be updated when
you perform an ExpressionEngine update.

Step 2: Update the Wiki Module
------------------------------

Log into your ExpressionEngine Control Panel and visit this page:

Modules > Wiki

Accessing that page will automatically tell ExpressionEngine to perform
any internal updates that are needed for the new version.

**IMPORTANT:** When you click on the link to the Wiki module, the update
will begin taking place. Do not close your browser window or click on
any links until the page has finished loading. Depending on the size of
your wikis, the update may take several seconds to complete.

Step 3: Version Specific Notes
------------------------------

Please view the update notes that apply to any versions that are newer
than the version you have been running.

-  `Version Notes 2.0 <wiki_update_notes_2.0.html>`_
-  `Version Notes 1.2 <wiki_update_notes_1.2.html>`_
-  `Version Notes 1.1 <wiki_update_notes_1.1.html>`_

*You're done!*
