Introduction
------------

ExpressionEngine's Search Module has several individual tags that work
together to perform searches and display search results.

Simple Search Form
------------------

The `Simple Search Form <simple.html>`_ tag allows you to easily add a
single-form search field to your site. This allows you to have a simple
search box in a sidebar of your site.

Advanced Search Form
--------------------

The `Advanced Search Form <advanced.html>`_ tag allows you to display a
detailed search form that will allow your users to make "power searches"
to find the information they need.

Displaying Search Results
-------------------------

The `Displaying Search Results <results.html>`_ page details the tags
available for controling how you display results from your searches.

Search Syntax
-------------

In addition to the options you have available for selection on the
Advanced Search Form, you can also narrow down your searches by using
special syntax with in the search keyword field.

-  To search for a phrase, place the words inside double quotes. e.g.
   "Lance Armstrong"
-  To search for entries without certain words or phrases, place a
   negative sign ("-") before it. e.g. "Lance Armstrong" -charity
