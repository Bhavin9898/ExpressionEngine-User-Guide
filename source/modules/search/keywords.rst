Search Keywords
===============

``{exp:search:keywords}``

This tag lets you display the keywords used to perform a search. It is
used on the search results page in order to show the user exactly what
search terms they used.

This may also be used on the template specified by the
`no\_result\_page <advanced.html#par_no_result_page>`_ parameter of the
`simple search form <simple.html>`_ and `advanced search
form <advanced.html>`_.

There are no parameters or variables associated with this
ExpressionEngine tag.
