Search Total Results
====================

``{exp:search:total_results}{total_results}{/exp:search:total_results}``

This tag lets you display the total number of results found during a
search. It is used on the search results page to show the total number
of matches.

This may also be used on the template specified by the
`no\_result\_page <advanced.html#par_no_result_page>`_ parameter of the
`simple search form <simple.html>`_ and `advanced search
form <advanced.html>`_.

The only variable associated with this tag is {total\_results}.
