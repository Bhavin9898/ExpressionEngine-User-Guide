Encrypt PayPal Buttons and Links?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Determines whether or not form data for PayPal purchase links and
buttons is encrypted or not. Encryption greatly reduces the ability of
someone to alter the purchase data for your items.

**REQUIREMENT:** Enabling this requires that your server have
`OpenSSL <http://php.net/manual/en/ref.openssl.php>`_ support compiled
into PHP. Ask your server administrator for this information.

.. note:: Enabling this requires that you use a public certificate and
   private key. Please read the section
   on :ref:`simple_commerce_encrypted_payments` for full details. In
   order	to be the most effective, you should also change your PayPal
   account	settings to only accept encrypted payments.
