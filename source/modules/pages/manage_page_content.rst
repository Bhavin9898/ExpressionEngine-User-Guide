Managing Page Content
=====================

|Pages Management|
You can manage your Pages and Pages module configuration by going to the
Modules area, and then clicking Pages.

Here you can create, edit, view, and delete your Pages, as well as
access the `Pages Module Configuration <configuration.html>`_

**Note:** It is not necessary to give content authors access to the
Modules section of the site to create and manage pages. Pages are merely
channel entries assigned to a specific URL in the Pages tab of the
Publish area, so regular permissions to create and edit channel entries
is sufficient for a content author to manage page content.

documentation for `publishing an
entry <../../cp/content/publish.html#tab_pages>`_.
