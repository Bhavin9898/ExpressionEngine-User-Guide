jQuery Module
=============

The ExpressionEngine jQuery module simplifies how you access jQuery in
your templates, and allows you to use the provided jQuery resources
included with ExpressionEngine, without disclosing the system folder
location or requiring that it reside in a publicly accessible location.

   ExpressionEngine, preventing you from having to maintain multiple
   jQuery resources.
