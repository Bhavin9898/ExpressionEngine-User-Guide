Cookie Consent Module Control Panel
===================================

.. rst-class:: cp-path

**Control Panel Location:** :menuselection:`Add-Ons --> Modules --> Cookie Consent`

Checkbox Display
----------------

Once the Cookie Consent Module is installed, login to both the frontend and
the backend of the site will require explicit consent to set cookies. This
consent is indicated by the existence of a cookie named cookies_allowed. There
are a variety of ways you may gain consent and then have this cookie set. For
you convenience, a setting is provided to have a checkbox field automatically
added to the backend login page that will allow users to grant their consent.

By default, the module is set to add this checkbox in order to allow administrators uninterrupted access to the control panel.  If a more elaborate modification to the backend login is desired, this setting can be turned off and a custom theme page added.  If you need to add links to a privacy policy or include a detailed description of the cookies used on the site, a custom theme page will be a better permanent option.
