Forum Themes
============

The ExpressionEngine forums make use of "themes" to determine how they
are displayed. The Forum Module comes with a "default" theme, which is
located in your installation under themes/forum\_themes/.

The theme files may be edited from within the ExpressionEngine Control
Panel under Modules > Discussion Forum > Templates. In order for you to
be able to edit the Templates inside the Control Panel, you must first
set the theme .php files to 666 permissions (for Windows servers, you
need to make them "writable").

If you plan to make changes to your theme, we recommend that you make a
copy of the themes/forum\_themes/default/ directory, name it something
else, and make your changes to that one. You can assign the theme for
your forum to use under the Default Preferences.

If you have more than one theme installed, you can easily change between
your themes simply by choosing a new one under Default Preferences.

For anyone creating their own theme or modifying one, the original "PSD"
version of the "ExpressionEngine Forums" graphic `is available for
download <http://expressionengine.com/files/forum_logo_psd.zip>`_.
