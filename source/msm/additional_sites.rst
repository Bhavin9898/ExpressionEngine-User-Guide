Add Sites to MSM
================

Each install of ExpressionEngine can power 1 site. Follow these steps to
:doc:`add more Sites </cp/msm/index>` to your ExpressionEngine installation.

Purchase Additional Sites
-------------------------

Pull up the `manage purchases <https://store.ellislab.com/manage>`__ page in
your account on EllisLab.com. (Make sure you're logged into the same EllisLab
account used to purchase the Multiple Site Manager license.) Next to the MSM
license in question, you'll see the option to *Add Sites*. Follow the checkout
process in the store.

Download New License Key
------------------------

After completing the order, head back to your `manage purchases
<https://store.ellislab.com/manage>`__ page and download your license key. You
will need to :doc:`upload the new license key </cp/settings/license>` before you
can add your new sites.
