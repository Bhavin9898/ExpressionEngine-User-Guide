Add Sites to MSM
================

Each install of ExpressionEngine can power 1 site. Follow these steps to
:doc:`add more Sites </cp/msm/index>` to your ExpressionEngine installation.

Purchase Additional Sites
-------------------------

Pull up the `manage purchases <https://store.ellislab.com/manage>`__ page in
your account on EllisLab.com. (Make sure you're logged into the same EllisLab
account used to purchase the Multiple Site Manager license.) Next to the MSM
license in question, you'll see the option to *Add Sites*. Follow the checkout
process in the store.

Download New License Key
------------------------

After completing the order, head back to your `manage purchases
<https://store.ellislab.com/manage>`__ page and download your license key. You
will need to :doc:`upload the new license key </cp/settings/license>` before you
can add your new sites.

.. note:: There is no explicit limit on the number of MSM sites that can be 
installed on a single installation of ExpressionEngine.  However, there is a 
technical limit on the size of your MySQL database table rows (see the `MySQL 
documentation <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/column-count-limit.html>`__). This 
effectively limits the total number of custom channel fields, and thus 
ultimately the number of sites you can install.  Depending on the types of 
fields and the MySQL storage engine, row size limits could pose a problem with 
anywhere between 500 - 2,000 custom fields.  If you are concerned you may be 
using too many custom fields, our support team can help you decide whether 
more sites can be supported.
