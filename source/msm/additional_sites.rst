Add Sites to MSM
================

When the :doc:`Multiple Site Manager </cp/msm/index>` expansion is added to an
ExpressionEngine installation, it enables the software to power up to 3
MSM Sites. Follow these steps to add more Sites to your ExpressionEngine
installation.

Purchase Additional Sites
-------------------------

Pull up the `manage purchases <https://store.ellislab.com/manage>`__ page in
your account on EllisLab.com. (Make sure you're logged into the same EllisLab
account used to purchase the Multiple Site Manager license.) Next to the MSM
license in question, you'll see the option to *Add Sites*. Follow the checkout
process in the store.

When you purchase additional Sites, your Multiple Site Manager files are
automatically updated with the appropriate number of Sites.

Download New License Key
------------------------

After completing the order, head back to your `manage purchases
<https://store.ellislab.com/manage>`__ page and download your license key. You
will need to :doc:`upload the new license </cp/settings/license>` before you
can add your new sites.
