Multiple Site Manager

Manage multiple Sites from a single installation

"websites" (Sites) from a single ExpressionEngine installation. These
Sites can use your existing domain, sub-domains, a brand new domain, or
a combination of the above. Each Site is has its own set of preferences,
templates, and channels. This lets you leverage a single
ExpressionEngine installation across multiple internet properties.
