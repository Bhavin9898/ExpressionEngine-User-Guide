Update Notes for Version 2.1
============================

Stand-Alone Entry Form Update
-----------------------------

A number of minor changes have been made to the
:doc:`/modules/channel/entry_form`'s default template for 2.1. You may
need to adjust the markup around your file fields.

Added Registration Form Field
-----------------------------

The member registration form has been given a new email verification
field. This field is optional, but has been included in the default site
themes. You can retrofit your own themes by simply including the field
in the form.
