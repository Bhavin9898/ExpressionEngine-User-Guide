Upgrading from Freelancer to a Full License
===========================================

The *Freelancer License* was a previously available edition of ExpressionEngine
meant for small web design shops. On November 25, 2012, all existing Freelancer
License purchases were automatically upgraded to the new full
:doc:`ExpressionEngine License </license>`. Since *Freelancer* was a separate
build of ExpressionEngine with limited functionality, you'll need to run an
update on your Freelancer-based installation of ExpressionEngine with the
`latest download package <https://store.ellislab.com/manage>`_ to get the full
functionality of ExpressionEngine.

To upgrade your installation from Freelancer to the new full ExpressionEngine
License, just follow the standard :doc:`Update Instructions
</installation/update>`.
