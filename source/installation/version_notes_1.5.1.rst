Language Additions
------------------

ExpressionEngine 1.5.1 has a number of language file additions. To
assist translators in updating their language packs, a :download:`language notes

lists all of the new language keys, separated by the each language file
that contains changes. To update your language pack, you can download
this text file, make the changes, and simply copy the new keys to the
appropriate language files.
