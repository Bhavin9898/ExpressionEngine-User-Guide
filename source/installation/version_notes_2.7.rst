Update Notes for Version 2.7
============================

SafeCracker File
----------------

*SafeCracker* is now :doc:`Channel Form
</add-ons/channel/channel_form/index>`, and the *SafeCracker File*
fieldtype has been removed. Be sure not to include
:file:`safecracker_file` while restoring the
:file:`system/expressionengine/third\_party/` directory during the
update process.
