Version Notes for 4.0.0
#######################

ExpressionEngine 4.0.0 brings an number of changes, most of which are handled for you automatically in the update process.

The following list are items that you will want to be aware of.

- The following fields are no longer default member fields: url, location, occupation, interests, bday_d, bday_m, bday_y, aol_im, yahoo_im, msn_im, icq, bio.  Any of the fields that had content in them were replaced by custom member fields with the same name.  The variables have been removed from the member templates, though they will display as custom field data if a custom field was created.
- Member bday_d, bday_m, bday_y default member fields were replaced by a birthday date field.
