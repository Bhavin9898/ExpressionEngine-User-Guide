Update Notes for Version 2.1.5
==============================

Synchronize Files in the File Manager
-------------------------------------

In order for existing files to be properly added to the database, you
will want to synchronize each existing file upload preferences by going
to Content > Files > File Upload Preferences and selecting the
sychronize icon. See `Synchronize
Files <../cp/content/files/sync_files.html>`_ for details.

Language Additions
------------------

ExpressionEngine 2.1.5 has a number of language file additions. To
assist translators in updating their language packs, a `language notes
text file <language_notes_2.1.5.txt>`_ has been provided. This text file
lists all of the new language keys, separated by the each language file
that contains changes. To update your language pack, you can download
this text file, make the changes, and simply copy the new keys to the
appropriate language files.
