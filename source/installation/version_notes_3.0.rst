Version Notes for 3.0.0
#######################

ExpressionEngine 3.0.0 brings an immense amount of changes, most of which are handled for you automatically in the update process.

The following list are items that you will want to be aware of.

- Third party add-ons are no longer automatically updated. You will need to visit the :doc:`/cp/addons/index` and upgrade your add-ons there.
- We have added a number of new language keys.Custom languages will need to be updated for 3.0.
- The security lock preference in the individual :doc:`member group settings</cp/members/groups/form>` now applies to frontend member registration as well as backend registration.  If you allow users to register for membership, you must make certain the member group the user will be assigned to upon registration is unlocked.
