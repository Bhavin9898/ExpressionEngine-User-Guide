Upgrading from Core to Standard Edition
=======================================
 
To upgrade your software from :term:`Core` to the standard edition ExpressionEngine, just follow the usual :doc:`Update Instructions
</installation/update>`.
 
.. important:: If you are upgrading within the same version number (for
   example, from ExpressionEngine Core 2.5.4 to version 2.5.4 of the standard edition) then you do not need to run the Update Wizard as outlined in **Step 5** of the :doc:`Update Instructions </installation/update>`. Simply remove the :file:`system/installer` folder immediately.
