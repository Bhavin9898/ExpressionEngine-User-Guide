Upgrading from EE Core to a Standard License
============================================
 
*ExpressionEngine Core* is a free, feature-limited edition of our award winning
content management platform, and it can **only** be used on a website engaging 
in personal, non-commercial, or non-profit activities.
 
To upgrade your software from Core to the standard ExpressionEngine
License, just follow the usual :doc:`Update Instructions
</installation/update>`.
 
.. important:: If you are upgrading within the same version number (for
   example, from ExpressionEngine 2.5.4 Core to 2.5.4 Standard)
   then you do not need to run the Update Wizard as outlined in **Step 5** of
   the :doc:`Update Instructions </installation/update>`. Simply remove
   the :file:`system/installer` folder immediately.
