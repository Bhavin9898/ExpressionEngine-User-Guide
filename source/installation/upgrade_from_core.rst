Upgrading from Core to Standard Edition
=======================================

To upgrade your software from Core to the standard edition ExpressionEngine, just follow the usual :doc:`Update Instructions </installation/update>`.

.. important:: If you are upgrading within the same version number (for example, from ExpressionEngine Core 3.0.0 to version 3.0.0 of the standard edition) then you do not need to run the Update Wizard as outlined in **Step 3** of the :doc:`Update Instructions </installation/update>`. Simply rename or remove the :file:`system/ee/installer` folder immediately.
