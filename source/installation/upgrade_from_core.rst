Upgrading from Core to a Standard purchased License
===================================================

Follow the standard :doc:`Update Instructions </installation/update>`.

.. important:: If you are upgrading to the same version number (for
   example, from ExpressionEngine 2.5.4 Core to 2.5.4 Standard)
   then you do not need to run the Update Wizard as outlined in Step 5 of
   the :doc:`Update Instructions </installation/update>`. Simply remove
   the :file:`system/installer` folder immediately.
