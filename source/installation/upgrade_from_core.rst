Upgrading from EE Core to Standard Edition
==========================================
 
*ExpressionEngine Core* is a free, feature-limited edition of our award winning
content management platform, and it can **only** be used on a website engaging 
in personal, non-commercial, or non-profit activities.
 
To upgrade your software from Core to the standard edition ExpressionEngine, just follow the usual :doc:`Update Instructions
</installation/update>`.
 
.. important:: If you are upgrading within the same version number (for
   example, from ExpressionEngine Core 2.5.4 to version 2.5.4 of the standard edition) then you do not need to run the Update Wizard as outlined in **Step 5** of the :doc:`Update Instructions </installation/update>`. Simply remove the :file:`system/installer` folder immediately.
