Upgrading from Core to Standard Edition
=======================================

With the release of version 5, there is no longer a seperate Core license.  If you need to upgrade to version 5 from a version 3 or version for site on a Core license, see the instructions for :doc:`Upgrading from ExpressionEngine 4 </installation/upgrade_from_3.x_4.x>`.
