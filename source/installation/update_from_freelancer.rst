Upgrading from ExpressionEngine Freelancer to Commercial or Non-Commercial
==========================================================================

Follow the standard `Update Instructions <update.html>`_.

**Important:** If you are upgrading to the same version number (for
example, from ExpressionEngine 2.1.0 Freelancer to 2.1.0 Commercial)
then you do not need to run the Update Wizard as outlined in Step 5 of
the `Update Instructions <update.html>`_. Simply remove the
system/installer folder immediately.
