Update Notes for Version 1.1
============================

New Preferences
---------------

There are several new preferences under :menuselection:`Admin --> Weblog
Management`. Previously, there was a single 'Weblog URL' path
preference. There are now a number of path preferences which you may
wish to update. Here is a short description and possible example of
each:

-  **Weblog URL**: The URL to the particular weblog.
   http://example.com/index.php/weblog/index/
-  **Comment Page URL**: The URL where the comment page for the weblog
   is located. http://example.com/index.php/weblog/comments/
-  **Search Results URL**: The URL where search results from this
   weblog should be pointed.
   http://example.com/index.php/weblog/comments/
-  **Trackback Return URL**: The URL where you want people to visit when
   they see your trackbacks on other sites.
   http://example.com/index.php/weblog/comments/
-  **Ping Return URL**: The URL where you want people to visit when they
   see your link on sites that you ping. http://example.com/
