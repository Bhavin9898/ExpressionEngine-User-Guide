Update Notes for Version 1.1
============================

New Preferences
---------------

There are several new preferences under Admin > `Channel
Management <../cp/admin/channels/channel_management.html>`_.
Previously, there was a single 'Channel URL' path preference. There are
now a number of path preferences which you may wish to update. Here is a
short description and possible example of each:

-  **Channel URL**: The URL to the particular channel.
   http://example.com/index.php/channel/index/
-  **Comment Page URL**: The URL where the comment page for the channel
   is located. http://example.com/index.php/channel/comments/
-  **Search Results URL**: The URL where search results from this
   channel should be pointed.
   http://example.com/index.php/channel/comments/
-  **Trackback Return URL**: The URL where you want people to visit when
   they see your trackbacks on other sites.
   http://example.com/index.php/channel/comments/
-  **Ping Return URL**: The URL where you want people to visit when they
   see your link on sites that you ping. http://example.com/
