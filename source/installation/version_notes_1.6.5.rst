Update Notes for Version 1.6.5
==============================

Strict URLs
-----------

During the update, the new `Strict URL
preference <../cp/design/templates/global_template_preferences.html>`_
is either enabled or disabled depending on your Site's "404 Page"
setting. If you have a "404 Page" set, then Strict URLs will be
*enabled* for the site, to provide the closest match to existing
behavior. If you do not have a "404 Page" set, then Strict URLs will be
*disabled*.

jQuery for the Control Panel Extension
--------------------------------------

ExpressionEngine 1.6.5 includes a new control panel extension, `"jQuery
for the Control
Panel" <../cp/add-ons/extension_manager.html#jquery_extension>`_. The
language file for this extension will already be updated if you have
followed the instructions on updating your language folder, but you will
need to upload the ext.cp\_jquery.php file from the download to your
/system/extensions/ folder.
