New members do not appear as an option in the author list
=========================================================

Newly added members aren't appearing as a selectable option in the
author list of the Control Panel's publish page.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Members must be specifically added to the multi-author list. For
individual members, this can be done via :menuselection:`Members -->
View All`, clicking the member's name and checking **Include user in
PUBLISH page multi-author list?** under "Member Preferences".

The appropriate permission for entire member groups can be set at
:menuselection:`Members --> Member Groups --> Edit Group --> Member
Account Privileges`.
