Changing the field formatting for existing entries
==================================================

Changing the default field formatting does not affect existing entries.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Changing the default formatting options for a channel field at
:menuselection:`Developer --> Categories` will only affect future entries.

If the new formatting is to be applied to existing fields as well, care
must be taken to select **Update all existing weblog entries with your
new formatting choice?** at the bottom of the page whenever the default
field formatting is changed.
