Moving entries to another channel
=================================

A user wishes to move an entry from one channel to another.

Troubleshooting
---------------

In order to move channel entries from one channel to another, both
channels must share the same

-  category groups
-  fields and field groups
-  and statuses.

If they do, the channel of each entry can simply be selected from the
drop-down menu in the Options tab of the Control Panel.
