Control Panel is Unstyled
=========================

CSS is not being applied to the Control Panel

Troubleshooting Control Panel CSS
---------------------------------

If the control panel appears without styling, first check to make sure
that the **themes** folder exists and contains a complete **ee/cp**
folder. You may wish to re-upload the **themes/ee** folder to
ensure it is complete.

If all themes files are present, you will want to double check your **Themes directory** and **Themes path** in your :doc:`/cp/settings/urls`. Keep in mind that **Themes path** is a *full server path*, for instance ``/home/example.com/public_html/themes/``. If you do not know what to use for your full server path, contact your web host or sysadmin.
