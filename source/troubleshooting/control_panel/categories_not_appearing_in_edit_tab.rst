Category List is not appearing in the Edit tab
==============================================

When navigating to the Edit tab in the Control Panel and choose the
Category drop-down list in the filter options, only "All" and "None" are
shown, not any specific categories.

Making Categories appear
------------------------

In order to use the category filter a channel must first be chosen.
Select a channel from the channel filter drop-down and the associated
categories will appear in the category filter.
