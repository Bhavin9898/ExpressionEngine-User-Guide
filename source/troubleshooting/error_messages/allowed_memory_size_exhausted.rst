Allowed memory size of ... bytes exhausted
==========================================

ExpressionEngine returns the following error: **"Allowed memory size of
... bytes exhausted."**

Troubleshooting memory issues
-----------------------------

This error indicates that a PHP process on the server ran out of memory.
The amount of available memory for PHP will vary from server to server.
ExpressionEngine 2.0 requires a minimum of 16M memory allocated to PHP.

The solution to this error is to increase the memory limit. This would
have to be done by the server administrator or host.
