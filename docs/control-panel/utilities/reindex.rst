.. Overview

Search reindexing refreshes the searchable words stored by Grid and Fluid fields that are used by the search module when performing a search. Reindexing is needed when:

 - a Grid field's search setting changes
 - the search settings for columns in a Grid field change
 - fields are removed from a Fluid field
 - the Search and Replace tool acted on a Grid or Fluid field

This tool will cycle through all Channel Entries that have a Grid or Fluid field assigned to them and re-index the entry data in those fields.
