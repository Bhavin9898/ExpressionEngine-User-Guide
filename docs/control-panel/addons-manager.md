# Add-On Manager

**Control Panel Location: `Developer > Add-Ons`**

This section of the Control Panel is where add-on functionality is installed, updated, configured, and removed. They can be filtered by status and developer, and sorted by the add-on name and version. This section is divided into to sections, one for add-on functionality included with ExpressionEngine, and one for third party add-ons.

## Installing Add-ons

The Add-On Manager will not download and install add-ons for you. In order to install an extension you must first place the add-on package in your `/system/user/addons/` folder and then when you reload the Add-On Manager the add-on will automatically be available for you to install.

NOTE: **Note:** Add-ons might require other tasks to function correct, so make sure to follow any instructions included with the add-on.
