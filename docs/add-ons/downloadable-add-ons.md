## License

The EllisLab downloadable add-ons listed below are open source and freely available on [Github](https://github.com/EllisLab/)

Most EllisLab downloadable add-ons are open sourced under the MIT license. The full license for each add-on is included in the `README.md` or a `LICENSE` file as part of the download. You can see a [typical example of the license](https://github.com/EllisLab/Kanban-Board/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Add-ons

[TOC=3 hide]

### Allow EE Code

Allows ExpressionEngine code to be used in entries. This add-on should be used with extreme caution, if at all. Ask yourself if you should really be putting tags inside content. If you are confident the answer is yes, here you go!

### Auto Linker

Automatically creates links from URLs and/or email addresses contained within the given text.

### Cron

Allows the calling of plugin and module scripts on a regular, scheduled basis. Unlike a true server cron that can be scheduled to the second, it is triggered by hits to the page that includes your cron tag. It should be used on templates that get regular traffic, or that are themselves accessed by a server cron.
